# UI Challenge

In this challenge, your task is to test an Android for proper UI functionality. 

## Instructions

Create a fork in your account, perform the following tasks, and then submit a pull request back to this repository.

## What you will be building

* Provide at least two test cases that prove the request behavior works as intended
* Provide at least two test cases that prove the response behavior works as intended
* Provide at least one test case that proves the request behavior does not work as intended (there's a bug)
* Provide at least one test case that demonstrates boundary based testing
* Provide at least one negative test case

Your testing of the function should demonstrate your ability to analyze a system and understand it's intended behavior, and verify that it succeeds or fails to meet those expectations.

## The System Under Test

1. Change the page URL being used to http://uitestingplayground.com/
2. Write a test to validate that clicking on Business link in header navigates to the Business section by validating URL.
3. Feel free to add/modify/remove existing tests if needed.
4. Configure the script where anyone should be able to run all tests by executing npm test
