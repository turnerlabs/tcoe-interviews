# DevOps Challenge 2

## What you will be building

 Scenario is listed below
  
  We would like to create a new function we plan to launch next year for an existing product. We expect to have a small amount of sporadic traffic go to this new system, so please allocate some serverless functions inside AWS for this product. Some of the requirements we expect to need for this product are listed below

  * Please allocate 1 lambda function with a "hello world" script
  * Connect the function to an API gateway so it can recieve traffic publicly

  ### Additional Requirements

  * scripts must be defined in [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
