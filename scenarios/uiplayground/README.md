# UI Challenge

In this challenge, your task is to test a website for proper UI functionality. 

## Instructions

Create a fork in your account, perform the following tasks, and then submit a pull request back to this repository [turnerlabs/tcoe-interviews (github.com)](https://github.com/turnerlabs/tcoe-interviews). Once you start working on the coding challenge, you have to finish the challenge and raise the pull request within 4 hours. Make sure that you have to submit a PR within 48 hours from the time of invitation to complete the coding exercise. Feel free to reach out anytime if you have any questions.

## What you will be building

* Change the page URL being used to http://uitestingplayground.com/ and perform below tests based on the different components available on the website.
* Create a test that clicks Start button and then waits for the progress bar to reach 75%. Then the test should click Stop. The less the differnce between value of the stopped progress bar and 75% the better your result.
* Print button text when button element is using a dynamic ID.
* Create a test that clicks Start button and then waits for the progress bar to reach 75%. Then the test should click Stop. The less the differnce between value of the stopped progress bar and 75% the better your result.
* Perform a test where an element may appaear on a page after heavy JavaScript processing on a client side.
* Write a test case that proves the click request behavior does not work as intended (there's a bug). You can intentionally write a negative test case here.

Your testing of the functionÂ should demonstrate your ability to analyze a system and understand it's intended behavior, and verify that it succeeds or fails to meet those expectations.
