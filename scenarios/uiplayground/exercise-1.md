## What you will be building

 Scenarios are listed below
  
  Positive cases:
  * Change the page URL being used to http://uitestingplayground.com/ and perform below tests based on the different components available on the website.
  * Create a test for below scenario
    Navigate to the url -http://uitestingplayground.com/progressbar and Create a test that clicks Start button and then waits for the progress bar to reach     75%. Then the test should click Stop. The less the differnce between value of the stopped progress bar and 75% the better your result.
