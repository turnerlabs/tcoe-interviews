# Welcome to TCoE Interviews!

We have created a variety of Scenarios that we think are good ways to evaluate candidates technical skills during the interview process.


## Instructions

Create a fork in your account, perform one of the following scenarios, and then submit a pull request back to this repository turnerlabs/tcoe-interviews (github.com). 
Once you start working on the coding challenge, you have to finish the challenge and raise the pull request within 4 hours. 
Make sure that you have to submit a PR within 48 hours from the time of invitation to complete the coding exercise. 
Feel free to reach out anytime if you have any questions.

## Scenarios

* [API Challenges](scenarios/apiplayground/README.md)
* [UI Challenges](./scenarios/uiplayground/README.md)
* [Android Challenges](./scenarios/androidplayground/README.md)
* [DevOps Challenges](./scenarios/devopsplayground/README.md)

Your testing of the provided scenarios should demonstrate your ability to analyze a system and understand it's intended behavior, and verify that it succeeds or fails to meet those expectations.
